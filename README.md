# Course-Recommender-System

This project is a web-based course recommendation system built using Python and Flask. It helps users discover relevant online courses based on their interests, improving the learning experience by reducing the time spent searching across platforms.

## About the Idea

The idea came from observing that learners often feel overwhelmed by the number of courses available online. With no clear guidance, they waste time browsing through multiple platforms without knowing which course best fits their skill level and interest.

This system aims to provide personalized course suggestions by taking user input or preferences and matching them with curated course data.

## Real-World Problem Solved

Online learners face three common problems:

1. **Too many options** – It's difficult to choose the right course among hundreds.
2. **Lack of personalization** – Most platforms suggest generic courses, not tailored ones.
3. **Wasted time** – Users often start a course that doesn't match their needs and drop it later.

Our system addresses these issues by:

- Giving personalized recommendations
- Providing direct links to relevant course pages
- Allowing users to save favorite courses locally

## What Makes It Different

Unlike major platforms that focus only on hosting courses, this system focuses solely on **recommending** the most relevant courses across platforms. It acts as a **discovery assistant** rather than a course provider.

Key differences:

- Built as an open and lightweight tool for faster course recommendations
- Includes secure **sign-in and sign-up** functionality to personalize user experience
- Stores saved courses and progress using **localStorage**
- Simple, clean, and user-friendly interface
- Feedback modal for improving course suggestions over time
- Optionally integrates with AI logic for smarter recommendations in the future

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask (backend)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (frontend)
- LocalStorage (for saving data)
- SQLite or JSON (for course data)
